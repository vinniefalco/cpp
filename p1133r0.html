<a name="Abstract"></a><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
In [networking.ts] (also called "TS" henceforth) a <em>CompletionHandler</em>
is a callable object invoked when an asynchronous operation has completed.
The TS specifies customization points allowing an <em>executor</em>, a
<em>proto-allocator</em>, or both, to be associated with an instance of a
completion handler. Authors of asynchronous algorithms frequently need to bind
parameters to a completion handler and submit the resulting call wrapper to
another algorithm. Unfortunately when doing so with a lambda, or a forwarding
call wrapper such as <tt>std::bind</tt>, customizations associated with the
original completion handler are lost. This paper proposes wording which
forwards TS associations to call wrappers returned by the standard library.
</p>



<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Asynchronous algorithms are started by a call to an <em>initiating function</em>
which returns immediately. When the operation has completed, the implementation
invokes a caller-provided function object called a <em>completion handler</em>
with the result of the operation expressed as a parameter list. The following
code shows calls to initiating functions with various types of completion
handlers passed as the last argument.
</p>

<p>Using a lambda:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
async_read([&hellip;],
    [](std::error_code ec, std::size_t)
    {
        if(ec)
            std::cerr << ec.message() << "\n";
    });
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Using a function object:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct my_completion
{
    void operator()(std::error_code, std::size_t);
};

async_read([&hellip;], my_completion{});
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Using a call wrapper:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct session
{
    [&hellip;]

    void on_read(std::error_code, std::size_t)
    {
        async_read(sock_, buffers_,
            std::bind(
                &amp;session::on_read,
                this,
                std::placeholders::_1,
                std::placeholders::_2));
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To allow for greater control over memory allocations performed by the
implementation or asynchronous algorithms, the TS allows an allocator to
be associated with the type of the completion handler. This can be accomplished
two ways.
</p>
<p>Intrusively, by adding a nested type and member function:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct my_completion
{
    using allocator_type = [&hellip;]

    allocator_type get_allocator() const noexcept;

    void operator()(std::error_code, std::size_t);
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Or by specializing a class template:</p>
<pre><blockquote>
namespace std {
namespace experimental {
namespace net {

template&lt;class Allocator&gt;
struct associated_allocator&lt;my_completion&gt;
{
    using type = [&hellip;]

    static type get(my_completion const& h, Allocator const& a = Allocator()) noexcept;
};

}}}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The TS also allows control over the executor used to invoke the completion
handler, through customizations similar to the associated allocator.
</p>
<p>Intrusively, by adding a nested type and member function:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
struct my_completion
{
    using executor_type = [&hellip;]

    executor_type get_executor() const noexcept;

    void operator()(std::error_code, std::size_t);
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Or by specializing a class template:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
namespace std {
namespace experimental {
namespace net {

template&lt;class Executor&gt;
struct associated_executor&lt;my_completion&gt;
{
    using type = [&hellip;]

    static type get(my_completion const& h, Executor const& ex = Executor()) noexcept;
};

}}}
</pre></blockquote>



<a name="Problem"></a><h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Algorithms expressed in terms of other asynchronous algorithms are called
<em>composed operations</em>. An initiating function constructs the composed
operation as a callable function object containing the composed operation state
as well as ownership of the caller's completion handler, and then invokes the
resulting object. The class below implements a composed operation which reads
from a stream asynchronously into a dynamic buffer until a condition is met
(the corresponding initiating function is intentionally omitted):
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;
    class AsyncReadStream,
    class DynamicBuffer,
    class Condition,
    class Handler&gt;
class read_until_op
{
    AsyncReadStream&amp; stream_;
    DynamicBuffer&amp; buffer_;
    Condition cond_;
    Handler handler_;

public:
    read_until_op(
        AsyncReadStream&amp; stream,
        DynamicBuffer& buffer,
        Condition const&amp; cond,
        Handler handler)
        : stream_(stream)
        , buffer_(buffer)
        , cond_(cond)
        , handler_(std::move(handler))
    {
    }

    void operator()(std::error_code ec, std::size_t bytes_transferred)
    {
        if(! ec)
        {
            if(bytes_transferred > 0)
                buffer_.commit(bytes_transferred);

            if(! cond_())
                return stream_.async_read_some(
                    buffer_.prepare(1024),
                    std::move(*this));
        }

        handler_(ec);
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The implementation above contains subtle but significant defects which have
been a common source of bugs for years when using Asio or Boost.Asio. Any
allocator or executor associated with <tt>Handler</tt> is not propagated to
<tt>read_until_op</tt>, and thus will not be used in the implementation of
the call to <tt>async_read_some</tt>. In particular multi-threaded network
programs using the code above will experience undefined behavior when the
associated executor of a completion handler is a <tt>strand</tt>, which
is used to guarantee that handlers are not invoked concurrently.

The code above may be fixed by associating the composed operation with the
same executor and allocator associated with the final completion handler.
The simpler, intrusive method may be used here as we have access to the
necessary executor through the supplied stream:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;
    class AsyncReadStream,
    class DynamicBuffer,
    class Condition,
    class Handler&gt;
class read_until_op
{
    AsyncReadStream&amp; stream_;
    DynamicBuffer&amp; buffer_;
    Condition cond_;
    Handler handler_;

public:
    read_until_op(
        AsyncReadStream&amp; stream,
        DynamicBuffer&amp; buffer,
        Condition const&amp; cond,
        Handler handler)
        : stream_(stream)
        , buffer_(buffer)
        , cond_(cond)
        , handler_(std::move(handler))
    {
    }

    using allocator_type = std::experimental::net::associated_allocator&lt;Handler&gt;

    allocator_type get_allocator() const noexcept
    {
        return std::experimental::net::get_associated_allocator(h_);
    }

    using executor_type = std::experimental::net::associated_executor&lt;
        Handler, decltype(std::declval&lt;AsyncReadStream&&gt;().get_executor())&gt;

    executor_type get_executor() const noexcept
    {
        return std::experimental::net::get_associated_executor(handler_, stream_.get_executor());
    }

    void operator()(std::error_code ec, std::size_t bytes_transferred)
    {
        if(! ec)
        {
            if(bytes_transferred > 0)
                buffer_.commit(bytes_transferred);

            if(! cond_())
                return stream_.async_read_some(
                    buffer_.prepare(1024),
                    std::move(*this));
        }

        handler_(ec);
    }
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The addition of the nested types and member functions give <tt>read_until_op</tt>
the same allocator and executor associated with the caller-provided completion
handler. These associations are visible to other initiating functions, such as in
the call to the stream's <tt>async_read_some</tt>. Unfortunately, the code above
still has yet another subtle problem with significant consequences. Consider the
case where <tt>cond_()</tt> evaluates to true upon the first invocation. The call
to the stream's asynchronous read operation will be skipped, and the handler will
be invoked directly with an error code indicating success. This violates the TS
requirement that the final completion handler is invoked through the associated
executor:
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>13.2.7.12 Execution of completion handler on completion of asynchronous operation [async.reqmts.async.completion]</b>
<p>
If an asynchronous operation completes immediately (that is, within the thread
of execution calling the initiating function, and before the initiating function
returns), the completion handler shall be submitted for execution as if by
performing <tt>ex2.post(std::move(f), alloc2)</tt>. Otherwise, the completion
handler shall be submitted for execution as if by performing
<tt>ex2.dispatch(std::move(f), alloc2)</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The TS defines the helper functions <tt>post</tt> and <tt>dispatch</tt>
to provide the allocator boilerplate in the executor expressions above.
However, executors expect nullary function objects (invocable with no arguments).
In order to submit a call to the handler in the code above, it is necessary
to use a lambda to create a nullary function which invokes the handler with
the bound error code. Use of the lambda, along with a bit of extra code to
avoid a double dispatch for the case where the completion handler is invoked
as a continuation of the call to <tt>async_read_some</tt> would look thusly:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void read_until_op::operator()(
    std::error_code ec, std::size_t bytes_transferred, bool is_continuation = true)
{
    if(! ec)
    {
        if(bytes_transferred > 0)
            buffer_.commit(bytes_transferred);

        if(! cond_())
            return stream_.async_read_some(
                buffer_.prepare(1024),
                std::move(*this));
    }

    if(! is_continuation)
        std::experimental::net::post(
            stream_.get_executor(),
            [self = std::move(*this), ec] { self_.handler_(ec); });
    else
        handler_(ec);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Astute observers may wonder why the handler is called directly when the
composed operation is invoked as a continuation of the call to
<tt>async_read_some</tt> instead of using the associated executor's
<tt>dispatch</tt> function. The reason is that we are guaranteed that
the composed operation was already invoked through the associated
exector's dispatch function, because the implementation of <tt>async_read_some</tt>
must meet the requirements of 13.2.7.12 [async.reqmts.async.completion].
</p>
<p>
Readers without a deep understanding of Asio or [networking.ts] may not realize
that the code above contains another defect. It suffers from the same problem
found in the original implementation. The lambda type does not have the same
allocator and executor associations as the final completion handler, thus
violating contracts.
</p>
<p>
Having the lambda forward the associated allocator and executor of the
contained completion handler requires additional syntax and change to the
language. This paper does not propose such a language change, as none of
the possible changes explored by the author look palatable in the slightest.
</p>
<p>
Since the intent of the statement in question is to bind arguments to a
callable, to produce a new callable, a logical alternative is to consider
using <tt>std::bind</tt>, which looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::experimental::net::post(
    stream_.get_executor(),
    std::bind(std::move(*this), ec));
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
However, once again the code contains a defect! It does not solve the
problem, because the call wrapper returned by <tt>bind</tt> does not
forward the necessary associations. But unlike the lambda, in this
case the type is emitted by the library. Therefore, the library can
provide the specializations for the call wrapper.
</p>



<a name="Solution"></a><h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
The solution proposed in this paper is to specialize the [networking.ts]
class templates <tt>associated_allocator</tt> and <tt>associated_executor</tt>
for selected call wrappers returned by standard library functions. Each
set of specializations will simply forward the allocator and executor
associated with the wrapped function object to the call wrapper. We
note that there is at least one paper in flight (P0356R1) which adds
new call wrappers to the language, <tt>bind_front</tt> and <tt>bind_back</tt>.
They will need a similar treatment.
</p>

<p>
Here, some alternatives are explored and exploratory questions are answered:
</p><ul>

<li><p><b>Can't we use a lambda instead of a call wrapper?</b></p>
<p>
The problem with using a lambda expression to bind arguments to a completion
handler is the implicit type-erasing of the captured completion handler. The
anonymous type of the lambda expression emitted by the compiler is not part
of any specialization of the TS class templates <tt>associated_allocator</tt> and
<tt>associated_executor</tt>. Wording to address this in lambdas encounters
strong headwinds:
</p>
<ul><li>
The language specification now has a coupling to [networking.ts].
</li><li>
The language has no means to express that a lambda should inherit the
associated allocator and executor of a captured completion handler.
</li></ul>
<p>
For these reasons, this paper does not discuss solutions which require changes
to the language itself.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Shouldn't this apply to most call wrappers not just <tt>std::bind</tt>?</b></p>
<p>
In a nutshell, yes. However, specializations for type-erased call
wrappers (e.g. <tt>std::function</tt>) are unimplementable.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>How often is a TS-aware call wrapper actually needed?</b></p>
<p>
Authors of composed operations will almost always need the facility
described in this paper. We note that Asio[1], networking-ts-impl[2],
and Beast[3] each contain their own implementations of call wrappers
which forward the associated allocator and executor. Beast's interface
is public, while the others are implementation details. More generally,
the requirements specified in [networking.ts] 13.2.7.12 are difficult
to meet without a TS-aware call wrapper. A survey of open source projects
on GitHub shows that users repeatedly mistake losing the allocator and
executor association of completion handlers by naive use of lambdas
or call wrappers.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Why did you design allocator and executor associations this way?</b></p>
<p>
Note that the author of this paper is not the author and architect of
[networking.ts]. That person is Christopher Kohlhoff, who may be reached
by email. While this author can answer some questions about design choices,
ultimately it is the principal architect of the TS who can give accurate
and comprehensive answers to question regarding design decisions.
</p>

<li><p><b>Is there a better way to implement these customization points?</b></p>
<p>
Changing the method used by the TS to specify the associated allocator and
executor for completion handlers is out of scope for this paper, but could
be the subject of another paper. However, there is evidence to suggest that
such a paper will not be successful. The allocator and executor customizations
have the advantage of 13 years of existing practice in Boost, in other open
source projects, and in commercial settings. They have gone through a couple of
iterations along the way, in response to real world issues. These customization
points are not just associated types, but also algorithms to obtain the
correct instance of the type, which also allows the caller to specify a
fallback for the case where a selected default is needed. This author has
not been able to come up with another solution which both maintains the
expressive power of the TS customization points, and exhibits the same or
better level of simplicity and elegance. Perhaps someone else will have a
eureka moment and discover a better way, but it seems unlikely.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Can we make these customization points less error-prone?</b></p>
<p>
From the author's experience and the visible cascade of problems with the
example code in this paper, writing initiating functions and composed
operations correctly requires a demanding amount of experience and skill.
This is especially true when considering that such algorithms must also
implicitly exhibit correct behavior in multi-threaded environments. This
is accomplished by achieving a deep and thorough understanding of Asio or
[networking.ts] and applying that understanding to code.
The author and contributors to Boost.Beast have explored library solutions
to provide some correct boilerplate and higher level idioms to users in order
to make authoring composed operations easier to write. A little bit of progress
has been made on this front, but comprehensive improvements have been elusive.
We suspect that grand unifying solutions simply do not exist, and that the
level of complexity is inherent to the domain.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Should this be spelled <tt>std::experimental::net::bind</tt>?</b></p>
<p>
That also solves the problem, but introduce two new ones:
</p>
<ul><li>
Standard libraries now have separate bind implementations which differ only
in that one of them is TS-aware, and the other isn't.
</li><li>
The guidance to users becomes "use this call wrapper, unless you are wrapping
a completion handler, in which case use this other call wrapper."
</li></ul>
<p>
We find this objectively worse than leveraging the call wrappers which already
exist in the standard library.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>How about we remove <tt>std::bind</tt> and add <tt>std::experimental::net::bind</tt>?</b></p>
<p>
Functions like <tt>std::bind</tt> which return call wrappers are part of the
standard library today, and removing them is out of scope for this paper, so
we do not propose that here.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>But <tt>std::bind</tt> is bad, I will only accept its deprecation and removal!</b></p>
<p>
Technically that isn't a question. We note that the improvements suggested in
this paper are by no means a show-stopper. [networking.ts] can go on without it,
and we could always add this in a future revision of the standard if desired.
Authors of composed operations can write their own call wrapper, or they can
use the one provided in Boost.Beast which is rapidly gaining popularity for
its approach of compatibility with [networking.ts] and established practice.
Regardless, a non-zero fraction of users will reach for <tt>std::bind</tt>
when authoring library code that accepts instances of completion handlers.
Without these changes, those users will produce code which is certain to be
incorrect. Therefore, for as long as the standard library provides functions
which return call wrappers, it is prudent to ensure that those call wrappers
are well integrated with [networking.ts].
